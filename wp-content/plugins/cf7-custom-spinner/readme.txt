Customize the spinning Loader Animation of Contact Form 7

== Description ==

For good reason the Contact Form 7 plugin is the most used contact form plugin for WordPress. The downside is that you see the same boring spinning animation on zillions of websites. The CF7 Custom Spinner plugin allows you to customize this loader animation!

== Retired Plugin ==

Development, maintenance and support of this plugin has been retired in october 2023. You can use this plugin as long as is works for you. 

There will be no more updates and I won't answer any support questions. Thanks for your understanding.

Feel free to fork this plugin.

== Usage ==

Customize the spinner animation in ‘CF7 Custom Spinner’ section of your WordPress Dashboard. That's it!

== Customization Options ==

This plugin allows you to choose from

* 12 animations
* 16 colors
* 3 sizes

(which gives a total of 576 possible combinations)

== Requirements ==

The only requirement for this plugin is that you have the Contact Form 7 plugin installed and activated.

== Plugin Privacy Information ==
